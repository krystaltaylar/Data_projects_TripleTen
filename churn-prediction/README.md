# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction Project

## üìç Project Description

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that identifies which customers are most likely to cancel their subscriptions, enabling proactive retention efforts and improving customer lifetime value.

## üß≠ Project Structure

- **Data Exploration:**  
  Analyzed churn distribution, service types, contract types, demographics, and payment methods to identify key patterns.

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**  
  - Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.  
  - Scaled numerical features.  
  - Addressed class imbalance by upsampling the minority class.

- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  Trained and compared multiple models including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - LightGBM Classifier
  - CatBoost Classifier  

- **Model Selection:**  
  - LightGBM was selected as the most optimal model. 
  - Achieved an AUC-ROC score of **0.90** on the test set.

- **Model Explainability:**  
- Analyzed and visualized feature importance to explain the most influential factors contributing to customer churn.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the notebook `Finalproduct.ipynb` to:

- Explore and clean the data  
- Train and evaluate models  
- Visualize performance metrics and feature importance  
- Generate churn predictions

## üßæ Conclusion

LightGBM successfully identified customers likely to churn with AUC-ROC, accuracy, and F1 score. Key churn drivers included:

- Number of subscriptions
- Use of month-to-month contracts  
- Electronic check payment method  
- High monthly charges  

With an **AUC-ROC of 0.90**, this model provides a reliable foundation for churn mitigation strategies.

## üí° Suggestions for Business Improvement

- Launch targeted campaigns for high-risk churn segments (e.g., offer discounts for long-term contracts. senior citizen discounts).    
- Promote use of auto-pay methods by incentivizing bank or credit card payments.
